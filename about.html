                    <summary>When and how were doughnuts first made?</summary>
                    <p>The history of the doughnut itself is generally traced to Dutch immigrants in 17th- and 18th-century New York, then New Netherland, who prepared fried dough balls called olie koeken or olykoeks, which means “oil cakes.” They were similar to modern doughts, although they did not yet have the iconic ring shape.</p>
